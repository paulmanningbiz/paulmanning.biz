Its incredible
Your so delectable
Your so delicious
All of my wishes
Have come true
When I first saw you

I think it is wonderful
That your so beautiful
It's obvious to see
You were made for me
And that is so amazing

Because your  amazing

I love to see you smile
hear your laughter any time
As I watch you when your sleeping
I listen to your breathing

and the tranquillity is captured
in the stillness of these moments
I want this pure joy to be
multiplied by infinity
