<h3><a href="#">My Movember Moment</a></h3>
<h6>Written by <a href="#">Paul Manning</a> Sunday, November 13, 2011</h6>

<p>

As you may or may not know November is renamed Movember in which men (and perhaps a few women)
don't shave for the month and are sponsored for this non action. All monies accrued goes to  charity.
At church I noticed a man with a very long impressive beard which was almost in the same league
as professor Dumbledores. Naturally I went up and introduced myself. The following conversation is
recorded for posterity:

</p>

<pre>

'Where are you from' I inquired

God' was his succinct reply

'Cool' I respond in kind

'I don't like american slang' he said

'Where do you live' I pursued

'On Earth' was his reply which although geographically true was nevertheless unrevealing.

'What a coincidence'  I responded 'me too'.

'Are you a Father' he asked, seeing I was holding my daughter Isabel.

'Yes' I confirmed.

'Be a good Father' he wisely encouraged

'Are you a Father?' I asked

'No' he replied.

I then asked him if he was growing his beard as part of the Movember Month sponsorship for charity.

'I don't answer stupid questions' he said emphatically

I took this as a sign not to continue this strange even for me conversation.
