<h3><a href="#">Come Inside</a></h3>

<pre>

If  you can accept me despite my limitations
Care for me without any reservations
Maybe even be my inspiration

Then  come inside
Don't be shy
Inside its warm and dry
Come inside
You know I care
Step inside
Love is here

And if you can accept me despite the complications
I'll be there for you without any hesitation
Maybe I could be your inspiration

Then come inside
I'll keep you warm
I will be your shelter from the storm
Then you will find peace and calm
Come inside
For you belong (right by my side)

I trace your lips with a finger
You respond with a gesture
That communicates so softly
That we still have a future
And the tranquility is captured
In the still of a moment
I'd like the moment to be
Multiplide by infinity

So come inside
Don't be shy
Inside its warm and dry
Come inside
You know that I care
Step inside
For love is here
