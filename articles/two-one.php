<h3><a href="#">Two become One</a></h3>
<h6>Written by <a href="#">Paul Manning</a> Monday, March 11, 209</h6>

<pre>

were the promises just a form of delusion
the whole wide world seems to be in collusion
to perpetuate the illusion

that two can become one

do I need to climb to a higher plane
to survey the whole terrain
a new perspective for me to gain

on how two can become one

I know the physics of being physical
I know the mind is more than just chemicals
But what I am talking about includes the spiritual

is it real or is it just fake?
a pantomime played by the human race
I'm finding it hard not to lose my faith

that  two can become one

I'm feeling vulnerable and I need your persuasion
To help disperse this sense of isolation
maybe even be my consolation

I look at you and the world seems alright
Come over here and hold me so tight
Stay with me tonight

I know that we two can be one
