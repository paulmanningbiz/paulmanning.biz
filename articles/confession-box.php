<h3><a href="#">Confession Box Empty</a></h3>

<p>

Today I committed not one but two heinous crimes which I hope one day to be forgiven. It all started when
I sought shelter from the inclement weather whilst waiting to meet Fabio at our pre-arranged location.
I noticed the Actors chapel, St. Malachy and knew it would be ideal place for rest and meditation. I quietly sat
down at a pew but soon curiosity got the better of me and I decided to take a stroll around the building. I am
always desirous of learning something new especially with regards to religion and my knowledge of the catholic
church is rather scant.

</p>  <p>

First thing to draw my attention were the numerous candles burning in various locations. I soon discovered the area
wherein candles could be purchased in either $1, $5 and $6 dollar varieties. I was fairy certain the candles were
not meant to be taken home in order to provide light during a power outage but seemed to have a mystical purpose
that receives its full force only within the confines of a legally sanctioned Roman Catholic dwelling house. Of
course I could be entirely wrong.
</p>  <p>

As I stood there I was suddenly consumed by a strange desire to light the $5 candle. Yet simultaneously  I had no
desire to make even a modest contribution to Pope Benedict XV coffers. What was I to do? I decided that the Gods
and saints must be placated so hesitantly I  lit a candle in honour of deities and saints unknown without slipping
a fiver into the donation box. I then waited to find out if I had offended the Vicar of Christ or perhaps the graver
sin of upsetting his boss.

</p>   <p>

Nothing happened so I continued my walk around the chapel when I came face to face with none other than St.
Thaddeus, patron saint of Lost causes. Now if there is anyone who can claim to be a lost cause, surely I should be
head of the queue. This is when the second heinous crime came to mind. I know that the Old Testament strictly
forbids bowing down and worshipping before graven images but the Statue of St. Thaddeus was so inviting that I
yielded to temptation and knelt down in the designated spot facing the great man himself.

</p>  <p>

&quotOh Thaddeus patron saint of lost causes&quot I silently addressed him and continued "you might not be privy to
the knowledge that my soul is destined to eternal damnation due to my many crimes. Let me enumerate them for your
benefit. The evil deeds include being a terrible husband who abandoned his wife and children;  continuing to believe
in the obviously made up story of Joseph Smith and his supernatural visitations; and perhaps worst of all, having
the album &quotGuilty&quot by Barbara Streisand and The Bee Gees on my favourites iPod play list."

</p>  <p>

I  was slightly disappointed when St. Thaddeus did not show any outward manifestation that he had heard my humble
supplication.I then had the sudden brainwave (or was it Thaddues prompting me?) to seek out a priest, bishop or
primate to hear my confession and therefore get my sins absolved. Of course I was not confident that a priest would
listen to my story due to the small technicality that I am not a member of his flock or even his brand of faith.
Also I secretly hoped that God's representative would not have read the part in 2nd Nephi which hinted the catholics
might actually be the great and abominable church. Of course no offense was implied nor indeed intended, at least
not by me for the aforementioned scripture.

</p>  <p>

I was convinced that three Hail Marys on an improvised rosary bead would be suffice to transmute my eternal
punishment into a celestial reward. Alas, no ecclesiastical authority could be found.  Perhaps the God of Abraham,
Isaac and Jacob is not quite ready to forgive me just yet.
