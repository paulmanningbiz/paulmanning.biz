Last night I had a dream
It was all about you
It seemed so real
I'd like to tell you how I feel

Parallel lines revealed your existence
And melted my resistance
I'd been waiting for so long
I thought the dream had long since gone
But I was wrong

So with eager anticipation
I could see your growing formation
And with exquisite delight
I could see the end was in sight
To light up my life

It's amazing

Grace
Now I'm longing to see your face
And baby, I'll be amazed
by your sweet embrace

Oh Grace
Longing to see
Your arms and your legs
And your tiny little hands
And your toes (repeat)

So these words are dedicated to my unborn child
What will you be
So many possibilities

A  black & white image confirmed your existence
Melted my resistance
I'd be waiting for so long
I thought the dream had long since gone
Daddy was wrong

Your amazing

Grace
Now I'm longing to see your face
And baby, I'll be amazed
by your sweet embrace

Oh Grace
Longing to see
Your arms and your legs
And your tiny little hands
And your toes (repeat to fade)
