<h3><a href="#">Jesus & Me Part I</a></h3>

Unbeknown to me, two young men  had independently of each other decided to cross the ocean to knock
on my door and deliver a personal message from the creator of the  universe. I was naturally deeply
impressed that this great Intelligence, whether hypothetical  or real  had actually taken time out to
of His busy schedule to concern himself with my obscure life. I was equally impressed that not one but
actually two young American's who were only slightly older than me were willing to  get on a plane
and relocate to the North of England in order to find me. Why would they bother I wondered.
After all I am just  a nobody  who had just turned seventeen a week earlier.

They were called Elder Steve Paige and Elder Keith Nolan and belonged to a church I had never heard of.
Of course they had no idea what my address was as the Almighty had neglected to reveal my  current
abode. But being resourceful and energetic they had decided to knock on as many doors as necessary
until they found me. They were each given two years  to accomplish this task and  were almost thwarted
from gaining success as I wasnt home when they finally knocked on my door.

Fortunately my dear Mama was on hand to save the day and she invited them into our humble home
even though she had no interest in their message as it didnt have anything to do with Bingo or
Jumble sales. God does indeed work in mysterious ways and I returned home just as they were
about to leave. Thus I was eventually   introduced to God's special little helpers, the Mormons.
