<h3><a href="#">The Mother Of All Sunday's</a></h3>

Having recently acquired a number of digital books for an undisclosed fee, I felt I needed to redress
the balance by purchasing a real physical book from as established bookshop. My reasons were
twofold; first I of course have a build in inclination to read and secondly I don't want bookstores
to go bankrupt due to the ease of digital copying.

</p>  <p>

As it's mother's day, I purchased a book for Mimi called 'A Successful Jewellery Business'
by Angie Boothroyd  and  wrote inside:

</p> <p>

Dear Mother,

</p> <p>

Without you, we literally wouldn't exist. Thank you for all you have done for us. Especially the
treasured  piano lessons. We know you are an aspiring entrepreneur so hope this little book can
be a catalyst in helping you make your millions. We of course won the biological lottery
of life by having you as our mother.

</p>  <p>

All our love on this special mothering Sunday

</p>  <p>

Pablo, Sam, Isabel

Mimi did ask me last night to buy some flowers on the children's behalf but I responded with
an uncharitable statement in which she replied:

</p>  <p>

'You are as ugly on the inside as you are on the outside'

</p> <p>

which I perhaps deserved on this occasion.

</p>  <p>

I also bought for myself 'The Biology of Belief' by Bruce Lipton which expands on his youtube video
Biology of Belief  which says the environment affects the  cells more  than genetic instructions
within the cells.He then states we can control our life through outr thoughts.
I also on the spur of the moment bought a book called 'Gone Girl' by Gillian Flynn.
The Observer kindly tells me it is the 'Thriller Of The Year'.

</p> <p>

So I have recently started to buy books on fiction. Well two so far, this one and'the 100 year old man who ...' which
was a brilliant book. Even my son Sam, 12 having just finished it concurred with my evaluation.

</p>  <p>

When walking from the Strand to Foyle's just below Tottenham Court Rd, I saw a queue which went
all the way up to Blackwell's bookstore. It consisted of people of colour , actually black or brown
to be precise. I naturally stopped and asked what they we queuing for. I gentleman
with a sign giving queuing instructions informed me that 'Nothing to lose' by Edir Macedo had been
signed by the author and they were going to collect their book. A lady even promised to purchase
a copy for me if I were  willing to join the procession but I estimated a couple of hours
wait in the cold so declined this most gracious offer.
