	I have the right stuff, the left over stuff and enough stuffing for the Christmas turkey. I am every Man 
	and the Man with no Name. I am the Man from Uncle and The Boy From The Hood (aka Robin). As Tin Tin 
	once noted ... I am a confection of perfection ... perhaps not, but my greatest work of art so far. 
</p>

<p>
	I am a man for all seasons. a mixture of Sir Thomas Moore, Emmanuel Swedenborg, Joseph Smith, 
	Eddie Izzard and Stephen fry.

	If you cut me, will I bleed? Does hope spring eternal? is the grass always greener on the other side 
	and was Paul Newman ever tempted to go out for a cheeseburger even though there was always steak at home?

	I am working diligently to find a cure for cancer. I also meditate frequently on achieving world peace. 
	I use a bow and arrow to catch all my unsuspecting prey in order to get the requisite daily calorie count
	(low carbon footprint).
	I run a marathon bi monthly and all sponshorship monies accrued goes to the charity of my choice which currently is 
	SAVE THE Amazonian speckled back tree frog.

<p>
	I am also in the process of perfecting an Astral projection technique which will bring the 
	Intercontinental Airlines to their financial knees. Also I am in the process of inventing and 
	patenting (maybe red) a neural distrubution processor using an advanced nano technology technique 
	to redefine the quassi linguistic multi-dynamic levitation process ... it should be in the shops 
	in time for the Christmas rush.

<p>
	I think about the meaning of life; the complications of love; can intelligence emerge from non 
	intelligence; can nothing produce something ? Is Rchard Dawkins really extra clever or has he a 
	missing link or three? 
</p>

<p>
	Are there 6 degrees of separation between me and a giraffe? Do amoeba have feelings; What would Jesus 
	discuss if I bumped into him when he is on that bus (what if God was one of us); why the fruit orange 
	should be given a proper name; whether charisma can be manufactured and if so would it be cost 
	effective to bottle it and sell by the bucket load.
