<h6>Chapter One: The Match Box Mystery </h6>

</p> <p>

He was just an ordinary boy, at least he thought so. And it would be just another ordinary day, at least he assumed it
would be. But he was wrong, very wrong. I am of course referring to Joseph Noventa, the young man known to all and sundry
as Joey. Joey of course dreamed of being an adventurer but he had long since figured out what he imagined was the
unbridgable gulf between fantasy and reality. Little did he realise that today that gulf would shrink to inconsequential
proportions.  Everything about his world was about to change and he had not even the remotest idea it would start today.

</p> <p>

As he walked to school he saw on the pavement a small matchbox which he naturally picked up. 'I wonder if there are any
unused matches inside' he said to no one in particular. To find out he opened the box and discovered a  folded piece of
paper with the words 'OPEN SESEME SEEDS' in bold typeface. 'What's that supposed to mean' he muttered and put the box
and paper into his back pocket. By now he had arrived at school and wanted to keep his 'Curiosity' for later when he was
alone.

</p> <p>

After yet another thrilling day at school learning  about the capitals of the world, he arrived home and went straight
into his bedroom, emptied out his pockets, opened the matchbox and took out the paper and unfolded it. It read:
</p> <p>
THIS IS NOT A COINCIDENCE JOEY, YOU HAVE BEEN SELECTED FOR A SPECIAL ASSIGNMENT. SHOULD YOU CHOOSE TO ACCEPT, THEN LIGHT
THE ONE REMAINING MATCH IN THE BOX TO DESTROY THIS MESSAGE AND FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS WILL BE REVEALED IN DUE COURSE.
</p> <p>

Joey was more than slightly puzzled 'How is my name written on that  paper, as anyone could have picked up the matchbox'
he reasoned to himself. But a special assignment; what could it be? His imagination began to get carried away as he
thought about the possibilities. Maybe he would be joining the famous KI7 child genius SpyRing. Or perhaps it was a top
secret mission for space exploration that needed a smart school boy to do what no adult could ever do. But what exactly
would that be? As his mind wandered from one possibility to the next he suddenly had two almost simulteonous thoughts.
The first was 'Is this a big joke and am I being filmed right now. Will I be appearing on the TV Show TV'S Funniest Pranks?'.
The other thought was "Okay, I accept; I'm going to light that match'.

</p>

<h6>Chapter 2: The Chicken Soup & Scotch Egg Puzzle </h6>

</p> <p>

Joey was unsure as to what to do next. He had lit the match & burned the note as per instructions but nothing happened.
He wasn't sure exactly what he was expecting but it suddenly dawned on him that perhaps this was a setup after all & Varney
Peabrain from the TV Show might actually jump out of the wardrobe & scream 'YOU'VE BEEN PRANKED' But that didn't happen
either. So nothing had happened, absolutley didley squat NOTHING & a feeling of disappointment began to seep through him.

</p> <p>

Then gradually  an interesting though began to penetrate  into his conscious mind 'have I misunderstood the message?'.
As the paper no longer existed, it was impossible to reread the instructions it contained. Joey resolved to concentrate
& meditate in order to recall the contents of the note. As he relaxed, a phrase seemed to filter through the clutter of
his random thoughts & a smile slowly appeared on his face. He repeated the phrase to himself several times 'in due course,
in due course', that he realised might be the key to understanding what was to happen next.

</p> <p>

He was convinced that he was right & something very memorable was going to happen to him. And he hoped it would be quite
soon. After all he was quite an unusual boy & even though he considered himself quite a humble young man, he had to admit
he was quite smart. But smart enough? That of course was  the million dollar question. It seemed as someone had concured
with him & he couldn't wait to find out all the delicious details.

</p> <p>

Two weeks had gone by since the matchbox incident & Joey had almost forget about it when he received a letter in the post
addressed to Master Joseph Neventa. He hadn't received many letters in his life thus far so he eagerly tore it open and
took out the paper. It read

</p> <p>

'Joey, this is the second message we have communicated with you. Your first test of knowledge is the following:  what
came first: The chicken soup or the scotch egg?'

</p> <p>

p.s. please think very carefully before answering this question as your response will help us determine whether you are
the right candidate for this very dangerous assignment'.

</p> <p>

p.p.s. please email your reply to wedefinelydontexist@MI7.com within 72 hours

</p> <p>

p.p.p.s. Good luck, we have every confidence in you

</p>

<h6>Chapter 3: The Almost Final Solution</h6>

</p> <p>

'chicken soup & scotch egg', Joey mused on the words over & over again; 'I wonder if it is refering to the eternal
conundrum of what came first, the chicken or the egg'. As a smart boy he decided to google the subject & found the wiki
page. Having read the article the answer was either 'unknowable' or 'evolution has answered it by stating a non bird
animal such as a lizard may have laid the egg and a chicken was hatched'. That is quite silly he exclaimed to himself
as he reasoned  you would then have to ask  'what came first the first creature that could lay an egg or the egg itself'.

</p> <p>

He also wondered if 'soup and scotch' were  key words or just a red herring (not literally of course). He had now spent
two days pondering the puzzle and it didn't seem as if he had made any progress and now he only had 24 hours left to
come up with an answer. What if instead of 72 hours someone had already answered it in 72 minute was joey's next thought.
Had he already blown the opportunity of living a 'life less ordinary'.

</p> <p>

Well he was not about to give up so decided he needed a distraction before revisiting the problem.  Ice cream & fruit
salad. That he decided was the answer and a chance to play his 'new favourite' game called 'shoot the messenger: ultimate
edition' to amuse himself. He  had after all  no homework to hand in & everything on the telly was rubbish in his
considered and mature opinion.

</p> <p>

After his game fix he quickly decided that soup and scotch were just a distraction & that he would have to choose one of
the wiki solutions or a variant or even more implausibly a novel take on the question. He decided the answer was
unknowable but knew this would not be an impressive answer. Of course you don't need to be a boy genius to answer
'I don't know'. So what else could he say that might persuade the decision makers that he was the right boy for the job.
Now that was something he could answer and he started to deliberate on how best to express the ideas that were just
coming to his attention.

</p> <p>

So he logged onto gmail and started typing...

</p> <p>

I have taken considerable time in studying your puzzle to no avail. I don't think there is genuine answer to your
question and therefore I assume you will agree with me that it was never your goal to seek one from me. If this
assumption is correct then I have had to ask myself what I can do to show you that I am willing, able and qualified to
be of assistance to you. As you probably already know, my Father enrolled me into the special Knowledge Is Power
Program four years ago and I have been a KIPPER ever since. This I beleive has prepared me both mentally & physically
and perhaps even spiritually to be of service in this great time of need. I therefore have attached my last report
which contains detailed analysis of my accomplishments over the last four years. I am of course your most obedient
servent.


And with that he pressed the 'send' button & hoped for the best.

</p> <p>

Joey was rather surprised to receive a reply to his email within 30 minutes of sending it. In it he was invited to come
along to a selection process which would entail him being away from home for 6 weeks and if successful a possible
further 3 month period. He was advised to discuss this with his parents before making any decision.
