Excerpt From My Resignation Letter From Lebara

<p>
Dear Lebara Employee (insert your name here)
</p>
 
<p>
You are receiving this email due to us having crossed paths over the last few months. May I say without hesitation it has been a pleasure working with such 
an intelligent and wise person as yourself (yes I mean you).  Your unbounded enthusiasm towards the Lebara values and dedicated focus on attaining the magic 
'Million Euro' profit has not gone unnoticed.
</p>
