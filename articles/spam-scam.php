Hello Dearest.
</p>
<p>
I am glad to write given the opportunity now. Hope you are fine.I thank God for you. Your message was a bit relief
for me. May God protect you for me. I hard of fantasy in paper that is why i found you.In this camp,we are only
allowed to go out from the camp only on Mondays and Fridays of the weeks. Its just like one staying in the prison
and I hope by Gods grace and with your help I will come out here soon. I don't have any relatives now whom I can go
to all my relatives ran away in the middle of the war.
</p>
</p>
The only person I have now is . Rev Thomas lamberth. who is the Reverend Minister in charge of the church in this
camp .The pastors e-mail address is (revthomoslambeth@yahoo.com)
</p>
<p>
He has been very nice to me since I came here but I am not living with him rather I am living in the woman's hostel
because the camp have two hostels one for men the other for women.ThePastors Tel number is ( 221-76-7442470) i will
like you to call me through his number. If you call tell him that you want to speak with me CHARITY, he will send
for me in the hostel.
</p>
<p>
As a refugee here I don't have any right or privilege to any thing be it money or whatever because it is against
the law of this country. I want to go back to my studies because I only attended my first year before the tragic
incident that lead to my being in this situation now took place.
<p>
<p>
Please listen to this,I have my late father's statement of account and death certificate here with me which I will
send to you latter,because when he was alive he deposited some amount of money in a leading bank in London which he
used my name as the next of kin,the amount in question is $5.7( Five Million, seven Hundred Thousand US Dollars).
</p>
<p>
So I will like you to help me transfer this money to your account and from it we can travel toEurope and live there.
I kept this secret to people in the camp here the only person that knows about it is the Reverend because he is like
a father to me. So in the light of above i will like you to keep it to yourself and don't tell it to anyone for I am
afraid of loosing my life and the money if people gets to know about it. Remember I am giving you all these
information due to the trust I deposed on you. So i need your information such as

<pre>

Your Full Names ......
Age .......
Address ......
Telephone .........

</pre>

<p>
so that i will send it to the bank Meanwhile I will like you to call me like I said i have a lot to tell you.
Have a nice day and think about me. Awaiting to hear from you soonest
</p>
<p>
Thanks and remain blessed

Hi Charity,
</p>

<p>
I feel your pain. Your honesty, courage & resilience shine through each word that you write.
May the God of Abraham, Isaac & Jacob come to your rescue. I will pray night and day or even day and night
(depending on the solar plexus variant) for your immediate release from these galling circumstances.
I have taken a vow of poverty, chastity & extreme wealth so your money will be protected by me.
My friend Robin can vouch safe for my integrity and financial prudence. You can call him on +44 191 455-8267
to get your own personal testimonial from Mr. Hood. Please send your bank details and I will get my bank manager
to do a hotwire transfer. Thank you again for choosing me to share your intimate details. Blessing await you in the
not too distant future.
</p>

<div class="panel">
Dearest,
</p>

<p>
I thank you ones again . I will also like to see you face to face and will use this opportunity to let you know
that GOD has chosen you to help me amongst other men on earth its now left for you and God who directed you to me
to help me out from this predicament i found myself. I know you are the kind of man that i need and you have to
confirm  from them because i believe in you and trust my life. I am not going to give your love to any other man
because i know you will satisfy me, so needless of looking for another man.
</p>

<p>
Please i have not told anyone except you and the Rev  Father about the existence of this  money and i will like
you to please keep it secret to other people because since it is (MONEY) all eyes will be on it. Remember i trust
you that is why i am giving you all this information!. My love is for you and you alone, I have informed the bank
about my plans to claim this money and the only thing they told me is to look for a foreign partner who will stand
on my behalf due to my refugee status and the laws of this country. You will have 15% of the total money for helping
me and the remaining money will be managed by you in any business of your choice. You don't have to go to London,
just write to the bank. This is the truth.
</p>

<p>
In this regard i will like you to contact the bank immediately with this information, tell them that you are
my foreign partner and that you want to know the possibilities of assisting me in transferring the ($5.7 Million
US Dollars) deposited by my late father of which i am the next of  kin to your account in your country.

Dear Charity,
</p>
<p>
Wonderful news for you my dear little petal. Your days of poverty are almost over. It just so happens that the
Royal Bank Of Scotland is only 45 minutes train distance from my home. I guess it must be true when you said that
God selected me as only He would know the proximity of my humble abode to this Royal Bank.
</p>
<p>

I have business in the city tomorrow so will take your details and discuss them in person with Mr. John Brawn.
I have already chosen names for our future little brood. They are Hamish, Cecil, Rupert, Gertrude, Tabitha & Toblerone.
Tell me what you think of these names & I will use my 15% to buy a bigger house for us to live in.
</p>

In sincerity

Charity,


<p>
You didn't comment on the names of our future brood. I take it you want a large family that will take care of
us when we reach an advanced age. If you don't like the names I have chosen then I am willing to compromise.
Alternative names could be Uzzi, Kaboozi, Sralinky & Blinky. Do you have any names for boys yet? Will I buy a
cottage or a condoninium with my proceeds? Are you able to provide any proof on your circumstances as I
have been told there are alot of artist of the con variety out there. Can you send picture of you and your
advisor together as well as a photo of the camp. This will set my mind at rest and I can tell my foolish
friends that you do have enormous affection for me and you don't have any ulterior motive.
I knows you will show your true colours and my friend Cindi Lauper will be grateful to know that your 'one of us'.
</p>

<p>

PS Is it possible you could fax a lock of your hair to me.?

Hi Johnny,
</p>

<p>
Good news. I have instructed my Solicitor to liaise with your Solicitor and perhaps join me in doing the lambeth walk.
Could you get your solicitor to call my solicitor on +44 208 570 7234 so they can vouchsafe each others credentials.
My solicitor is called The Right Honorable Anthony Bliar & is working 24/7 on my behalf in order for these funds to
be delivered into my in box, my out box or my shake it all about box.
</p>

<p>
Please do this asap as I need to put a down payment on my condominium in Palm Springs USA. Rest assured I will
keep all monitories for safe keeping & Dear Prudence (Miss Charity) will get her just deserts (rhubarb crumble).
So let my solicitor & your representative have a confab as quickly as possible. You can email him any relevant
documentation to tblair@mpobe.com
</p>

<p>
PS. do you have a DNA blood sample certificate as proof you are in correspondence with miss Charity. Please send to
my solicitor to expedite your request
</p>

<p>
This is when they finally give up & I received no more correspondence
