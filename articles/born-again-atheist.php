I was recently perusing the dedicated Richard Dawkins website when I happened to notice the feature
inviting those who once believed but are now atheists to share their conversion stories. I of course
could not resist emailing with my own made up conversion.

Dear Ricard,

</p> <p>

I was blind but now I see. I used to think that life was meaningful but now I know beyond the
shadow of a Kraut that it is completely and utterly meaningless. I owes it all to you.
My selfish genes and & greedy T-Shirt made me assume I was the centre of the known (& perhaps unknown)
universe. If science could have proven that a multi-verse existed then I would no doubt have
proclaimed I was the epicentre of that too. But no more. My insignificance has truly humbled me.
You have given God, Jesus, Angels & Devils their long overdue P45's and the world is such
a better place because of it.

</p> <p>

As science & Atheism abounds I have full confidence that wars
& rumours of wars will subside. The lion may not sleep with the lamb but a new era of peace &
tranquility will be the lot of homo sapiens once superstition & ignorance are banished to the
scrap heap of history. I thank Socrates, Spinoza & the beloved Apostle Charlie Darwin that you
were born. I propose that 26 day of the third month of each year should be celebrated for ages
to come as:

</p>  <p>

'Dicky Dawkins Day'

</p> <p>

so that no man, woman & even wildebeest will ever forget the day you were born. As the saying goes
'we are all Africans', I truly believe it was no accident that your birth was in the holy land of
Kenya near to the place we as a species came into existence. Philosophers & Scientist have speculated
whether evolution was destined to produce the world we now inhabit but I have no doubt that
future generations will proclaim that you Richard Dawkins were inevitable.

</p> <p>

Let the Double Helix,
the ShellFish Gene, the Peppered Moth and Darwin's Finches be a lesson to all the unbelievers that
Science has triumphed and Religion hath been vanquished. Your books are truly  'The Stone Cut Out Of
the Mountain Without Hands' to herald a new era & a new dawn of scientific enlightenment.

</p> <p>

Instead of spending my Sundays reading the Holy Books I now meditate on the meaning of the
'Blind Watchmaker', 'Climbing Mount Improbable' & the supernal 'God Delusion'. I no longer visit
'The Preacher Man' for a weekly fix but instead revel in the beauty of nature.

</p> <p>

I now ask myself the hard questions:

</p> <p>

Will the Leopard ever change its spots?

</p> <p>

        Will Man someday become Superman?

</p> <p>

Will the Praying Mantis ever give up its superstitions?

</p> <p>

Thank you once again. Your honesty, integrity & sheer brain power have helped me become an
intellectually fulfilled  Born Again Atheist.

</p>  <p>

Regards, Paul
