Excerpt From My Resignation Letter From Lebara

<p>

Dear Lebara Employee (insert your name here)

</p> <p>

You are receiving this email due to us having crossed paths over the last few months. May I say without hesitation it
has been a pleasure working with such an intelligent and wise person as yourself (yes I mean you).  Your unbounded
enthusiasm towards the Lebara values and dedicated focus on attaining the magic 'Million Euro' profit has not gone unnoticed.

</p> <p>

However I have received feedback that some employees are having difficulties in 'catching the vision'. I have therefore
in the spirit of leading, together produced a revised values list.

</p> <p>

First of all some employees have reported they can't tell the difference between 'Do the right things' and 'Do things
right'. We have listened, learned and responded in a timely manner. We have therefore decided to amalgamate these two
pieces of choice wisdom into one succinct and memorable saying: (drum roll please)

</p> <p>

Do it; Do it right; Do it right now (adapted from the influential lyricist George Michael's I'm Your Man)

</p> <p>

Also our legal department would like to remind everyone that the value 'feel the customer' is not an open invitation to
get the company into legal hot water (multiple law suits come to mind). Rather it is an invitation to walk in our
customer moccasins. Finally, lead together does not mean all opinions will have an equal status, rather to quote
Napolean from the book Animal Farm

</p> <p>

"All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others." . I hope you can embrace these minor changes in the spirit they were written.

</p> <p>

Finally you may have heard the rumour (started by me) that I along with Elvis will be permanently leaving the  building.
This is entirely true. On hearing that my limited skills and alleged abilities might not be required by the executivee
leadership team, I of course consulted a life coach through the mechanism of telephony (Lebara sim card). I was given
the following rather cryptic advise and would love for someone to expound on the meaning thereof:

</p> <pre>

Stand in front of the mirror and repeat the line "do you want fries with that"

</pre> <p>

I then consulted with a leading psychologist who put me through a battery on aptitude tests. Afterwards he told me he
had good news and bad news for me. The good news is I have an I.Q. on a par with an ex President of the United States
Of America. The bad news is it turned out to be George W. Bush.
