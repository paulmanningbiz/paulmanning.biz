Being Nothing / Being Whole (Updated)

I

Your account has been deleted
The password will expire
The email clearly stated
Your no object of desire

The review has been completed
Your influence rated zero
The feedback has been gathered
It's clear that your no hero

Your oxygen requirements
Have been reallocated
The space that you now occupy
Must shortly be vacated

II

The seeds of joy lie dormant
They're buried deep inside
Your task should you accept it
Is to bring them all to life

It will take some contemplation
And action is required
But the journey will be worth it
By what you have aquired

You have been given notice
The choice belongs to you
Your state of mind you'll surely find
Will make it all come true
