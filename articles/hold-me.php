Intro

so she said ....
and he said ...

Verse

he just wanted a positive distraction
she was hoping for a mutual attraction
he wanted acceptance not rejection
she was longing for love and affection

so she said
and he plead
and she schemed
whilst he dreamed

Chorus

she said 'hold me'
come over here and enfold me
it's been so long
I'm not so strong
It has been a while
since I felt love shine
It's light upon me

so hold me
just hold me

Verse

he was looking for a new direction
hoping to find love and affection
she wanted more than a physical attraction
she was longing for real satisfaction

so he said
and she plead
whilst he schemed
and she dreamed

Chorus

he said 'hold me' ......

Bridge

he just needed to feel wanted
and she wanted to feel needed
and I wanted to be wanted
and I longed to feel needed

so I said
and I plead
and I schemed
and I dreamed

that you'd hold me
you'd walk through the door and enfold me
It's been so long
I know that you belong
I've waited a very long time
Hoping to feel love shine
It's light upon me

so hold me
just hold me
