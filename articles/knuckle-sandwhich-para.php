        I was walking down 5th Avenue when I stopped to ask a policeman directions to Times Square
    </p>

    <p>
        'Technically your already in Times Square. Is there any where specific you want to go to?' he asked.
    </p>

    <p>
        'Yes' I replied. 'The Square'.
    </p>

    <p>
        As I continued walking I spotted a temptation that I knew would be impossible to resist. No, it wasn't a lady
        of ill repute beckoning me to purview her stamp collection but rather a street preacher was in mid flow reciting from the Good Book.
