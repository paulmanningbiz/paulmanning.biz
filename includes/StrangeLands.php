	Chapter 1: My Invisibility Cloak

	<p>
	The story that I am about to unfold may sound fantastic, strange or even dare I say it,  made up. Let me assure you that it 
	is absolutely true. If I had not experienced it myself, I would probably conclude  it to be the product of a deluded mind. 
	Perhaps multiple fragments from a warped imagination. And of course I can vouch safe that I am not delusional. However I  
	am always willing to receive feedback on reality from those who are experts in the subject. 
	</p>
	<p>
	So I will start at the beginning. Not the absolute beginning as that would entail me including boring and non essential details 
	which I have ruthlessly culled from this narrative.
	<p>
	<p>
	Being a highly rational and logical person, I found myself in a very puzzling situation which seemed to defy all logic and 
	any rational explanation. Two impossible things seemed to have happened simultaneously 

	<ol>
	<li>I found myself floating in the air near the bedroom ceiling and </li>
	<li>from this unusual vantage point, I could see a motionless body crumpled upon the floor who was either my 
	very own doppelgänger or perhaps even more bizarrely actually me.</li>

	<br>
	After pondering  this for some time, I could think of three possible explanations for this strange occurrence 
	<br>
	<ol>

	<li>I was in dreamland dreaming a distinct dream  </li>
	<li>I had accidentally discovered the art of astral projection or
	<li> this was a drug induced hallucination 
	</ol>
	I thought option one was plausible but unlikely. I assumed that astral projection was a fiction popularised by the new age movement and as to possibility three, I had never knowingly taken an illegal substance.

	Indeed it was a well known fact that I was the inspiration behind the hit song ‘Goody Two Shoes’ by Adam & The Ants with the keenly observed line 

	“don’t drink, don’t smoke, what do you do?”

	My riposte to Mr Goddard (aka Adam) and his assorted collection of non descript ants  would have been:

	‘‘apart from healthy lungs and liver I also have the option of living a life less ordinary”.

	Unfortunately due to a cruel twist of fate, I never got to meet the aforementioned singer of popular ditties (cleverly rendered as punk rock/new age) and  was therefore deprived of ever articulating my devastating response to what I assumed was a rhetorical question.

	I wondered what my son Toby would think about all this and to my amazement I was immediately transported to the living room where Toby was playing a spell binding game on his laptop.

	“Toby, you’ll never guess what just happened to me” 

	I said to no response. He was often too immersed in his game to be aware of anything else going on or to acknowledge my presence. After raising my voice and still getting no reply, I walked over to him and attempted to tap him on the shoulder to get his attention. I say attempted because my hand seemed to go straight through him. 

	“This has to be a dream” 

	I said to myself because my son could not suddenly turn into a non material being. Alternatively, perhaps I entered into an ‘Alice In Wonderland’ type parallel universe where I had mistakenly swallowed an invisibility pill that made communication with my son impossible.


	Chapter 2: The SpaceTime Conundrum

	To misquoth a line from Charles Lutwidge Dodgson "Things were getting curiouser and curiouser". I'd suddenly become invisible & as I reflected on my strange experience I couldn't help but think on how I'd gone from my normal everyday existence into a mysterious world where I'd become invisible, immaterial & utterly confused dot com. Also I seemed to have inherited an obscure superpower in that  I could think of a person or a location &  instantly I'd be transported to said person or place. Of course that is a superpower worth having in normal circumstances but the downside being that said person couldn't see me or hear me which made it far from ideal.

	There could only be one explanation for all of this I concluded. I had recently read a book by the noted scientist Professor Albus Dumbledore called "A Succinct & Rather Concise History Of The Space-time Continuum". In it he explained in rather vague and non mathematical terms how the forces of nature could temporarily cause a tare in the fabric of the multi-universe. If anyone had the misfortune of being in the vicinity when this happened would be thrust into another dimension with little possibility of getting back to mother earth (assuming they survived the ordeal). Of Course Professor Dumbledore said the chances of this happening were infinitesimally small but I am now living proof that he had discovered a universal truth previously unknown.

	"What about death?" 

	This strange thought seemed to penetrate my consciousness from nowhere as I was pondering my current circumstances. How could death explain anything when I was still obviously alive & fully conscious. Anyone who is anyone knows that death  is the permanent loss of consciousness & the disintegration of the body into it's constituent parts. After all I pride myself being a man of science; even a man of reason & logic & even though a tare in the fabric of the universe might seem incredible, what other explanation could there be?

	The thought suddenly occurred to me that there might be other individuals who either like myself had recently been thrust into this new world or have been permanent residents. No sooner had this thought occurred when I was found myself in the presence of a man who introduced himself as Albert Smith.

	"Where Am I?" I asked.

	"Where do you think you might be" he replied, I thought rather unhelpfully.  

	"If I'd known that I wouldn't have asked" I replied.

	"By answering the question to the best of your ability will help frame an answer which you can comprehend" he said rather cryptically.

	I proceeded to give Albert a brief summary of what had occurred & my explanation of what must have happened.
