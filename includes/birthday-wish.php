        Dear Real & or Virtual Friends
    </p>

    <p>
        Your best wishes have indeed made a huge contribution to my special day. It seems as if the forces of
        your collective consciousness were so powerful that it caused a tear in the space-time continium
        that enabled  me to slip seemlessly into a parallel universe for the limited period of twenty
        three hours, fifty nine minutes and sixty seconds.

    <p>
        To my surprise and delight, I was awoken by my beloved who was wearing her very own specially
        designed birthday suit. I was so intrigued that I spent the following hour studying its contours
        in intimate detail. This intense study naturally caused my appetite to build up and of course my
        Beloved had taken the time to pre-arrange a full English breakfast with
        freshly squeezed orange juice to be delivered to the room during moments of  distraction.
    </p>

    <p>
        After sharing this sumptuous meal, we at leisure relaxed and my Beloved regaled me with lines taken
        from  Shakespearean sonnets, the Bhagavad Gita and even quoted lyrics from &quotThe Greatest Hits&quot
        of the internationally acclaimed band Bucks Fizz. We were then chauffeured to Shaftsbury Avenue for the
        matinee showing  of my favourite musical &quotMe & My Girl&quot which of course showcased &quotThe
        lambeth Walk&quot. During the interval the stars of the show collectively surrounded me and broke
        out into a specially planned spontaneous rendition of the classic song &quotFeliz Cumpleanos&quot.
        I was especially thrilled when the leading lady sat on my knee and whispered in my ear &quotyou are
        my perspiration, or was it density, who knows? who cares?&quot.
    </p>

    <p>
        After the show, we naturally went to a Tapas Bar wherein a specially prepared paella was waiting for us.
        For pudding we were given Rhubarb & Custard which is not only my favourite desert but also the national dish
        of Albania.
    </p>

    <p>
        From here we walked up Electric Avenue where we were surprised to see Eddy Grant busking to earn a penny or
        three. My beloved sat on his knee and joined in with the chorus &quotGive me Ope Joanna, hope Joanna till the
        morning comes &quot or words to that effect. I non chantly picked up the spare guitar and rendered a superb
        solo that brought the house down (I think it was up to start with).I then thought we were going to see an
        obscure little band called &quotThe Stolen Roles&quot but in fact this was actually a surprise birthday party
        organised by you-know-who.The evening started off by me being selected to play in a special 5 aside footy game
        that included Johan Cruyff, Pele and Paul Gazza Gasgoine. It was Newcastle vs the Rest Of The World and
        naturally we won with me scoring the winner with a deft back heel flick that had the crowd stand up as one
        screaming &quotyou is da man&quot or something like that (my hearing isnt as good as it once was).
    </p>

    <p>
        After a quick dip in the jacuzzi with my Beloved , we returned to the arena
        which had been transformed into a wonderful stage designed for the entertainment of the public at large.First
        off Vince Clarke and Andy Bell were joined by Alison Moyet who did an acoustic version of &quotTenderest
         Moments&quot, followed by &quotRock me gently&quot which includes the lines
        &quotAnd I dream you're with me, You hold me sweetly,And rock me gently to sleep, In you arms&quot
    </p>

    <p>
        After a sitting ovation, Vince,Andy & Alison wandered off to be replaced by a special appearance of Elvis and
        Buddy Holly who of course are now Holograms.  They perform  with Rimmer from Red Dwarf and are  known
        collectively as  &quot3 dead Lice&quot. They sang an old favourite of mine &quotRave On&quot. Then Chubby
        Checker burst onto the stage to sing the song that started my dancing exploits with &quotLets twist Again&quot.
         After a brief  interlude wherein the audience consisting of 200 of my intimate acquaintances were each given
         a copy of my award winning album 'Life in the slow lane'...the show recommensed with Vittorio Grigolo & Hayley
         Westenra sang the beautiful &quotMay It be&quot and the classic duet written by yours truly &quotCall My
         Name&quot which for me was naturally the highlight of the evening.
    </p>

    <p>
        Afterwards, everyone was mandated to dance to the sound of a different drum plus other dance Floor Fillas. We
        ended the night with me singing my classic song &quotGolden Delicious&quot which includes the famous lines
        &quotits incredible, your so delectable, your so delicious, all of my wishes, have come true, because of
        you&quotAnd so off we went home and to our unbounded delight our 6 beautiful and wonderful children were awake
        to welcome us with hugs and kisses. Then my lovely family all surrounded me in sweet harmony to sing a  lullaby
        and I naturally drifted off to sleep. I awoke next morning and gave thanks to &quotThe Great Designer In the
        Sky&quot for such a beautiful day.
